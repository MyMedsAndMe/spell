# spell [DEPRECATED]

Spell is an [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) [WAMP](http://wamp.ws/) client
implementing the
[basic profile](https://github.com/tavendo/WAMP/blob/master/spec/basic.md)
specification.

Why WAMP?

[WAMP](http://wamp.ws/) is the Web Application Message Protocol supported by
[Tavendo](http://tavendo.com/). It's an open standard WebSocket subprotocol that
provides two application messaging patterns in one unified protocol: Remote
Procedure Calls + Publish &amp; Subscribe.

Why Spell?

- Flexible interface: one line blocking calls or raw message handling -- use
whichever tool works best.
- Robust peers: peer processes are supervised, and will restart or retry when
appropriate.
- Easy to extend: add new roles, transports, or serializers without changing
the core library:

## Getting Help

Spell uses GitHub [issues](https://github.com/MyMedsAndMe/spell/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/MyMedsAndMe/spell/pulls) for development.

Spell has a mailing list at spell@librelist.com; general questions or ideas are
welcome there. See [librelist](http://librelist.com/) for how to sign up.

## Using Spell with your Elixir Project

To use Spell from within your Elixir library add, add it to your `mix.exs` deps,
along with the required transport and serialization libraries:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    ...
    # Required:
    {:spell, "~> 0.1"},
    # Required if using the websocket transport:
    {:websocket_client, github: "jeremyong/websocket_client", tag: "v0.7"},
    # Required if using the JSON serializer:
    {:poison, "~> 1.4"},
    # Required if using the msgpack serializer:
    {:msgpax, "~> 0.7"}
  ]
end
```

Fetch the dependencies by running:

```
$ mix deps.get
```

## How it Works

You can run the examples you're about to run into, though first you'll need
[crossbar.io](http://crossbar.io/). You might install it via pip:

```shell
$ pip install crossbar
```

If you are going to use MessagePack you will need to install the optional
crossbar package.

```shell
$ pip install crossbar[msgpack]
```

Start an Elixir shell:

```bash
$ iex -S mix
```

<a name="crossbar-install"></a>Start up Crossbar.io:

```elixir
iex> Crossbar.start()
```

To stop Crossbar.io from IEx:

```elixir
iex> Crossbar.stop()
```

You can find more detailed documentation at any time by checking
the source code documentation. `Spell` provides an entry point:

```elixir
iex> h Spell
```

You can hit <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> to exit the shell. Be sure to stop Crossbar.io
first.

### Peers

In WAMP, messages are exchanged between peers. Peers are assigned a set of roles
which define how they handle messages. A client peer (Spell!) may have any
choice of client roles, and a server peer may have any choice of server roles.

There are two functional groupings of roles:

- PubSub
  - Publisher
  - Subscriber
  - Broker _[Server]_
- RPC
  - Caller
  - Callee
  - Dealer _[Server]_

By default a client peer is started with the above four client roles:

```elixir
Spell.connect("ws://example.org", realm: "realm1")
```


See `Spell.Peer` and `Spell.Role`.

#### Authentication

Spell supports
[WAMP Challenge Response Authentication (CRA)](https://github.com/tavendo/WAMP/blob/master/spec/advanced.md#challenge-response-authentication). This
is flexible, and can be used to back a variety of authentication schemes.

To setup a Spell peer with authentication:

```elixir
alias Spell.Authentication.CRA
authentication = [id: "harry", schemes: [{CRA, [secret: "alohamora"]}]]
Spell.connect("ws://example.org", realm: "realm1",
              authentication: authentication)
```

See `Spell.Authentication`.

### PubSub

Once subscribed to a topic, the subscriber will receive all messages
published to that topic.

```elixir
# Events must be published to a topic.
topic = "com.spell.example.pubsub.topic"

# Create a peer with the subscriber role.
subscriber = Spell.connect(Crossbar.uri,
                           realm: Crossbar.get_realm(),
                           roles: [Spell.Role.Subscriber])

# `call_subscribe/2,3` synchronously subscribes to the topic.
{:ok, subscription} = Spell.call_subscribe(subscriber, topic)

# Create a peer with the publisher role.
publisher = Spell.connect(Crossbar.uri,
                          realm: Crossbar.get_realm(),
                          roles: [Spell.Role.Publisher])

# `call_publish/2,3` synchronously publishes a message to the topic.
{:ok, publication} = Spell.call_publish(publisher, topic)

# `receive_event/2,3` blocks to receive the event.
case Spell.receive_event(publisher, subscription) do
  {:ok, event}     -> handle_event(event)
  {:error, reason} -> {:error, reason}
end

# Cleanup.
for peer <- [subscriber, publisher], do: Spell.close(peer)
```

See `Spell.Role.Publisher` and `Spell.Role.Subscriber` for more information.

#### Pattern-based subscriptions

By default, peers subscribe to topics using an exact matching policy. Using
pattern-based subscriptions a peer can receive messages that match certain
criteria.

```elixir
# assuming we have a subscriber peer connected

# exact match
{:ok, subscription} = Spell.call_subscribe(subscriber, "com.spell.my_topic")
# subscriber will receive messages published in the "com.spell.my_topic" topic

# prefix match
{:ok, subscription} = Spell.call_subscribe(subscriber, "com.spell.my_topic_prefix", options: %{match: :prefix})
# subscriber will receive messages published in topics:
# "com.spell.my_topic_prefix.foo",  "com.spell.my_topic_prefix.bar", ...

# wildcard match
{:ok, subscription} = Spell.call_subscribe(subscriber, "com.spell..my_topic", options: %{match: :wildcard})
# subscriber will receive messages published in topics:
# "com.spell.foo.my_topic", "com.spell.bar.my_topic", ...
```

### RPC

RPC allows a caller to call a procedure using a remote callee.

Let's start with the caller's half:

```elixir
# Calls are sent to a particular procedure.
procedure = "com.spell.example.rpc.procedure"

# Create a peer with the callee role.
caller = Spell.connect(Crossbar.uri,
                       realm: Crossbar.get_realm(),
                       roles: [Spell.Role.Callee])

# `call_register/2,3` synchronously calls the procedure with the arguments.
{:ok, registration} = Spell.call(subscriber, procedure,
                                 arguments: ["args"],
                                 arguments_kw: %{})

Spell.close(caller)
```

In addition to the synchronous `Spell.call_...` type functions described so far,
Spell includes asynchronous `Spell.cast_...` functions. To handle the result of
these messages you can use a `Spell.receive_...` helper, or, most flexibly,
use a `receive` clause.

Next is a contrived example showing the RPC caller and the callee being used
from a single process. Note how asynchronous casts and receive functions are
used to avoid a deadlock.

Note: I omitted the `arguments` and `arguments_kw` options for brevity's sake.

```elixir
# Calls are sent to a particular procedure.
procedure = "com.spell.example.rpc.procedure"

# Create a peer with the callee role.
callee = Spell.connect(Crossbar.uri,
                       realm: Crossbar.get_realm(),
                       roles: [Spell.Role.Callee])

# `call_register/2,3` synchronously registers the procedure.
{:ok, registration} = Spell.call_register(callee, procedure)

# Create a peer with the caller role.
caller = Spell.connect(Crossbar.uri,
                       realm: Crossbar.get_realm(),
                       roles: [Spell.Role.Caller])

# `cast_call/2,3` asynchronously calls the procedure.
{:ok, call} = Spell.cast_call(caller, procedure)

# `receive_invocation/2,3` blocks until it receives the call invocation.
{:ok, invocation} = Spell.receive_invocation(callee, call)

# `cast_yield/2,3` asynchronously yields the result back to the caller
:ok = Spell.cast_yield(callee, invocation.id, handle_invocation(invocation))

# `receive_event/2,3` blocks until timeout to receive the result.
case Spell.receive_result(publisher, call) do
  {:ok, result}    -> handle_result(result)
  {:error, reason} -> {:error, reason}
end

# Cleanup.
for peer <- [callee, caller], do: Spell.close(peer)
```


See `Spell.Role.Caller` and `Spell.Role.Callee` for more information.

### Adding New Roles

In Spell, Roles are middleware for handling messages. Technically they're most
similar to GenEvent handlers: callbacks which are hooked into a manager. In this
case, the manager is a `Spell.Peer` process.

It's easy to get started:

```elixir
defmodule Broker do
  use Spell.Role

  def get_features(_options), do: {:broker, %{}}

  def handle_message(%Message{type: :publish} = message, peer, state) do
    publish(message, peer, state)
  end

  ... shamelessly skipping the real work.
end

Spell.Peer.connect(Crossbar.uri, realm: Crossbar.get_realm(), roles: [Broker])
```

See `Spell.Role` for descriptions of the Role callbacks.

## Examples

Look in `examples/` for the scripts.

There are shortcuts to run the examples -- run the following from Spell's root:

```shell
$ mix spell.example.pubsub
```

## Testing

To run Spell's integration tests, you must have
[crossbar installed](#crossbar-install).


To run the tests:

```shell
# run unit and integration tests with default configuration
$ mix test

# run only unit tests
$ mix test.unit

# run integration tests using a specific serializer
$ SERIALIZER=json mix test.integration
$ SERIALIZER=msgpack mix test.integration

# run integration tests with all possible serializers
$ SERIALIZER=all mix test.integration
$ mix test.integration

# run unit and integration tests with all possible configurations
$ mix test.all
```

The Crossbar.io test server can be configured to listen on a different port
by running:

```shell
$ CROSSBAR_PORT=8000 mix ...
```

## Creating the Documentation

To generate HTML from the source code documentation you can run:

```shell
$ mix docs
```
